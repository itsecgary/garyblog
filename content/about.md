Hello, thank you for coming to my website! My name is Gary and I like a lot of things. If you have already explored my website, you could probably tell that I like doing CTFs and making cool things. Here is some basic info about me:


### Education

- Junior (class of 2022)

- Major: Computer Engineering

- Minor: Russian


### Work Experience

- 2021 Internship with Northrop Grumman working on an ASIC design team

- (Fall 2020, Spring 2021) Lab TA for intro to engineering course at UMD

- 2020 Internship with Northrop Grumman working on an ASIC design team

- 2019 Internship with Northrop Grumman doing Cyber

- 2018 Internship at a small provate company in Denver, CO doing IT

- 2017 Internship with my local school district in IT Security (doing penetration testing)


### Hobbies

I am passionate about cybersecurity, electrical engineering, computer science, and anything related to space, but my interests continue to grow as I meet new people and learn new things.


**CTFs:** These capture the flag competitions raise my competitiveness and help me be more flexible when it comes to topics on cryptography, reverse engineering, open source intelligence, and forensics. I really believe I'm gaining a lot out of doing these competitions, especially working with other people in a team!


**Video Games:** I used to play a load of video games up until my freshman year at UMD because I still had the time then lol. Some games I really liked to play includes Call of Duty and Apex Legends on console. I've been trying to play more solo games on my PC like Cyberpunk or games spoken in Russian to up my listening comprehension. 


**Binge Watching:** I usually have periods of full-on productiveness followed by long spurts of laziness, which allows me to feed this love of watching new TV shows or movies. Some of my favorite TV shows include Game of Thrones, Lost, and Silicon Valley. Most of my favorite movies exist in the MCU timeline like the first Iron Man and Avengers Infinity War.
