Hello, thank you for coming to my website! My name is Gary and I am a junior computer engineering major and Russian language minor at the University of Maryland. I am passionate about cybersecurity, electrical engineering, computer science, and anything related to space.

In my free time you can catch me working on projects, competing in CTF competitions, or binge-watching a new TV show or movie series.
