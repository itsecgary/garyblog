Hello and welcome to my blog! I will mainly use this website as a platform for CTF writeups, research, past coursework, and loads of projects. I've been meaning to make this website for a while now and I believe I've finally found a good setup. If you want to learn more about me, feel free to peep my [About Page](https://itsecgary.com/about.html)! 

In the future I might add some other pages to showcase what I am working on, but for now I will try to keep it simple - projects, coursework, cool stuff, and so on...

If you are a passionate indivudial like myself and would like to collaborate on a project or some research, feel free to reach out to me by [Email](mailto:petrovlev39@gmail.com)
